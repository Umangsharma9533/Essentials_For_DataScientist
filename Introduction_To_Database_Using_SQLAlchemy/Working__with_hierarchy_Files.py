#Alias : Used to represnt a table with another name. For example : we have a table of employee witn their manager in it, so in similiar way.,
# we will use the same table for the manager whiuch were manager for others
#Hierarichal Tables contains relationship in themselves

#Using alias to handle same table joined queries

# Make an alias of the employees table: managers
managers = employees.alias()

# Build a query to select names of managers and their employees: stmt
stmt = select(
    [managers.columns.name.label('manager'),
     employees.columns.name.label('employee')]
)

# Match managers id with employees mgr: stmt_matched
stmt_matched = stmt.where(managers.columns.id == employees.columns.mgr)

# Order the statement by the managers name: stmt_ordered
stmt_ordered = stmt_matched.order_by(managers.columns.name)

# Execute statement: results
results = connection.execute(stmt_ordered).fetchall()

# Print records
for record in results:
    print(record)
#Leveraging functions and group_bys with hierarchical data

# Make an alias of the employees table: managers
managers = employees.alias()

# Build a query to select names of managers and counts of their employees: stmt
stmt = select([managers.columns.name, func.count(employees.columns.id)])

# Append a where clause that ensures the manager id and employee mgr are equal
stmt_matched = stmt.where(managers.columns.id==employees.columns.mgr)

# Group by Managers Name
stmt_grouped = stmt_matched.group_by(managers.columns.name)

# Execute statement: results
results = connection.execute(stmt_grouped).fetchall()

# print manager
for record in results:
    print(record)
